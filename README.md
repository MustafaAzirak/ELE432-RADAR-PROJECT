Project Overview

The Ultra Sonic Radar System is an innovative project designed to detect and visualize objects within a field 
of view using ultrasonic sensing technology. This system utilizes the DE1-SoC FPGA development board to control 
an ultrasonic sensor and a step motor, while also processing and displaying the detected data on a VGA monitor. 
The integration of these components allows for precise distance measurements and real-time visualization of the
surroundings.

Components:

    DE1-SoC FPGA Board:
        Acts as the central controller and processing unit for the project.
        Generates control signals for the step motor and processes data from the ultrasonic sensor.
        Features a VGA output port for display purposes.

    Ultrasonic Sensor:
        Emits ultrasonic waves and measures the time taken for the waves to bounce back from objects.
        Provides distance measurements based on the time-of-flight calculation.

    Step Motor:
        Controlled by the DE1-SoC board to rotate the ultrasonic sensor in a field of view.
        Ensures accurate and consistent rotation to cover the entire area.

    VGA Monitor:
        Displays the processed distance data, allowing real-time visualization of detected objects.
        Provides a graphical representation of the radar's field of view.

System Workflow

    Ultrasonic Sensing:
        The ultrasonic sensor emits a pulse of ultrasonic waves.
        The sensor then listens for the echo of the waves bouncing back from objects.
        The time taken for the echo to return is measured and used to calculate the distance to the object.

    Step Motor Control:
        The DE1-SoC board generates control signals to rotate the step motor.
        The motor moves the ultrasonic sensor incrementally to cover the area.
        Each position of the sensor corresponds to a specific angle in the field of view.

    Data Processing and Visualization:
        The FPGA on the DE1-SoC board processes the distance measurements from the ultrasonic sensor.
        The processed data is used to determine the position of objects relative to the sensor.
        The FPGA generates VGA signals to display the detected objects on the VGA monitor, providing a real-time radar-like visualization.

Getting Started

To get started with the Ultra Sonic Radar System, follow these steps:

    Hardware Setup:
        Connect the ultrasonic sensor to the appropriate input pins on the DE1-SoC board.
        Connect the step motor to the DE1-SoC board, ensuring proper alignment and secure connections.
        Connect a VGA monitor to the VGA output port on the DE1-SoC board.

    Software Configuration:
        Program the FPGA on the DE1-SoC board with the provided control and processing code.
        Ensure the code includes the necessary drivers and control logic for the ultrasonic sensor, step motor, and VGA output.

    Calibration and Testing:
        Power on the system and allow the step motor to perform an initial calibration.
        Verify that the ultrasonic sensor is correctly measuring distances and that the step motor rotates smoothly.
        Check the VGA monitor for accurate and real-time visualization of the detected objects.
